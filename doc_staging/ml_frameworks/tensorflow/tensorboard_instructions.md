# Tensorboard Instructions

After you have logged into ThetaGPU, and have a Tensorflow run going, you'll need to know one of your worker nodes so you can SSH to it.

```bash
PORT0=9991
PORT1=9992
PORT3=9993
# Select a theta login node N where N=[1-6]
ssh -L $PORT0:localhost:$PORT1 $USER@thetaloginN.alcf.anl.gov

# after reaching thetaloginN

# Replace NN with your thetagpu worker node
ssh -L $PORT1:thetagpuNN:$PORT3 $USER@thetagpusn1

# after reaching thetagpusn1

# login to worker node
ssh thetagpuNN

# now setup your tensorflow environment
# for instance run the conda setup.sh script created during the install_tensorflow.sh script

# now run tensorboard
tensorboard --logdir </path/to/logs> --port $PORT3 --bind_all
```
